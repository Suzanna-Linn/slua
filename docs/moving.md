## Moving from LSL to SLua

Whether you're a seasoned LSL veteran or just starting your scripting journey, this guide is your bridge to SLua, the modern scripting language for Second Life. It focuses on the key differences to help you translate your ideas from LSL to the powerful and efficient SLua environment.

This section is specifically designed as a "translation guide," not a comprehensive manual for starting from scratch. A foundational understanding of LSL concepts is assumed. The focus is on what has changed or is entirely new in SLua. This approach directly addresses the practical knowledge needed to adapt existing skills and start leveraging the power of SLua immediately.

The pages within this section are designed to be read in the order they appear. The content is structured to create a progressive learning path, where each new topic builds upon the knowledge established in the previous pages. That said, it is sometimes unavoidable to make a brief reference to a topic that will be covered in more detail later on.
