## Moving from LSL to SLua

In this section, we will learn how to rewrite our LSL scripts in SLua through a two-step process:
* First, we will translate them into SLua while maintaining a structure as close as possible to the original LSL format (SLua in LSL style).
* Next, we will refine and improve them to take full advantage of Luaâ€™s capabilities (SLua in Lua style).
To follow this section effectively, a basic understanding of Lua is required, as covered in the previous two sections.
