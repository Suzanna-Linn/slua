## Scripts

This section is a growing collection of practical, ready-to-use SLua scripts you can use, adapt, and learn from.

The library is organized into subpages by topic, and each script description is marked with a color to indicate its difficulty level, as shown below.

This is a brand-new section, and the collection is just beginning to grow. Be sure to stop by every Sunday to see what new scripts have been added. Happy scripting!
