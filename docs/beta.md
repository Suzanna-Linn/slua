## What is new in the SLua Beta version

Slua Beta version is expected in November or December. It will be deployed in the Beta Grid (at least in the current SLua regions) and in a very few regions in the Main Grid.

I have collected information available about the changes coming in the SLua Beta version. Not all of it is clear and definitive, so the contents of this page could be evolving.

### Timers, library lltimers


### Multi-events, table evts


### LL functions compatibility, library llcompat
